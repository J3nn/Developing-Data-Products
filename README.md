For the course project, I built a BMI calculator on Shiny. The user would input his weight and height, which will be used to calculate his BMI and return a result based on the BMI categories provided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The BMI is a common measure used to determine the amount of body fat in one's body.
